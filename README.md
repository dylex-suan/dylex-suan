### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dylex Suan. I am a recent graduate of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo. I completed several internships in an array of different fields. I started working in full-stack development for a game company, then moved on to building an automation system from scratch in C++. Next, I worked in the embedded space, training machine learning models for microcontrollers, and dabbling in audio SWE. I finished my last internship building software for vehicles!

In my free time, I am a professional pianist and organist within my hometown, playing regularly for church services, weddings and funerals! ðŸŽ¹

I'm interested in low-level development and digital signal processing/computational audio! I worked with MATLAB/Octave developing a few projects during my undergraduate studies.
