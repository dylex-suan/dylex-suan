### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dylex, a 3rd-year Computer Science Student at the University of Waterloo! I finished my internship as a Software Developer Intern at [**Northern Mechatronics Inc.**](https://github.com/NorthernMechatronics), building machine learning models through Tensorflow for use on a microcontroller, particularly the NM180100 module! I've also published on Github related to my ML work [**here**](https://github.com/NorthernMechatronics/tflm_digits)! I was previously an automation developer at [**Peraso Inc.**](https://perasoinc.com/), a full stack developer intern at [**Prodigy Education Inc.**](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/) and a software developer for the **University of Waterloo**! Currently searching for **Winter 2024** and/or **Summer/Fall 2024** internships, and would love to network with other aspiring developers!
